For context for what follows, recall that Andy Casey (Monash) and Anna
Y. Q. Ho (Caltech) performed \textsl{The-Cannon}-like fits to
\textsl{LAMOST} spectra and searched the residuals for evidence of
Li-rich stars. They could have performed this fit by projecting the
residals against a derivative of spectral expectation with respect
to Li abundance.
