\paragraph{A data-driven approach to finding stars that eat rocks}
~

\noindent
by \textbf{Hogg} and others

\paragraph{Abstract:}
Using Ting-built spectral derivatives,
we can assemble a derivative of stellar spectral expectation with respect
to a Earth-like composition anomaly.
We can then---by various data-driven means---locate stars in the
\LAMOST\ data that show evidence of having (recently?) consumed
large quantities of rock.

\paragraph{Introduction:}
For context for what follows, recall that Andy Casey (Monash) and Anna
Y. Q. Ho (Caltech) performed fits (with \TheCannon) to
\LAMOST\ spectra and searched the residuals for evidence of
Li-rich stars.
They could have performed this fit by projecting the
residals against a derivative of spectral expectation with respect
to Li abundance.
That is, you can find abundance anomalies by projecting residuals away
from a data-driven fit onto spectral derivatives.

For further context, Semyeong Oh (Princeton) has found a pair of similar
(and co-moving) G-type dwarf stars in \Gaia\ data, where one of the pair
shows an enormous abundance anomaly that is chemically similar to the
bulk composition of the Earth.
This anomaly is not subtle; it would have been easy to find with a matched
filter.

For yet further context, Yuan-Sen Ting (Harvard) has computed derivatives
of the spectral expectation (the spectrum, really) for a star with parameters
$(\teff, \logg, \feh)$ with respect to element $k$ abundance $\ln X_k$.
He might have these derivatives in different units, but he can convert them
into the units ``per nat'' or ``per unit natural log'' at will.

\paragraph{Method:}
Choose a small bin in spectral parameters $(\teff, \logg, \feh)$.
Compute or obtain (from Ting) spectral derivatives $\dd f_\lambda/\dd\ln X_k$ for
all elements $k$ for the normalized spectra $f_\lambda$, relevant
to the stars in this small spectral-parameter bin.
That is, evaluate these derivatives at the parameters that are
appropriate for the stars in the bin.
(We always work in normalized-spectrum space in what follows; normalization
is presumed to be done, done correctly, and out of scope here.)

Obtain (from Oh) the derivatives $\dd\ln X_k/\dd M_\rock$ which tell
you the logarithmic increase in the abundance of element $k$ per unit
mass of rock dumped into a star with parameters $(\teff, \logg, \feh)$
appropriate to this spectral-parameter bin.
These derivatives are just the rock abundances divided by the stellar
abundances, and maybe some factor that accounts for the photospheric
mass of the star with parameters $(\teff, \logg, \feh)$.
Take the dot product
\begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{\dd f_\lambda}{\dd M_\rock} &=&
  \sum_{k=1}^K \frac{\dd f_\lambda}{\dd\ln X_k}\,\frac{\dd\ln X_k}{\dd M_\rock}
  \quad .
\end{eqnarray}
This is the derivative of the spectral expectation with respect to
the amount of swallowed rock, relevant to stars in this bin.

Now make a \emph{test set} of
stars that have spectra consistent with being in or near
the bin centered on $(\teff, \logg, \feh)$.
This test-set membership ought to be made loose, especially in the $\feh$
direction, because we are looking for anomalies!

For each star $n$ in this test set, do the following:
$\bullet$~Obtain a spectral expectation for star $n$ (more below).
$\bullet$~Subtract the spectral expectation to create a residual spectrum
          $\Delta f_\lambda$ for star $n$.
$\bullet$~Project the residual spectrum onto the rock derivative
          $\frac{\dd f_\lambda}{\dd M_\rock}$.
$\bullet$~Threshold the projection and append to the list of stars with
          high values of the projection (or not).
(And then publish, get famous, win prizes, retire early.)

As for the spectral expectation mentioned above, there are a few ideas.
One bad idea is to use physical stellar models. These are bad, and they
are particularly bad where we care about our residuals. One good idea
is to use \TheCannon, trained on a good training set that overlaps the
spectral bin.
Another good idea is to just make an empirical difference between star
$n$ and stars that are (empirically, in the data) spectrally similar to
star $n$, but \emph{in the tangent space} of the derivative 
$\frac{\dd f_\lambda}{\dd M_\rock}$.
That is, similar in spectral direction orthogonal to the derivative we
care about.

The key thing is that we want this spectral expectation to be data-driven,
or empirical.
Physical models just aren't good enough yet.
